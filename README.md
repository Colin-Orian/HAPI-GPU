HAPI - The Holography Library
This is a simple library for computing holograms.  It supports multiple algorithms the most interesting of which is ray tracing.  The program in the ray directory is a basic test of this.  The current system only ray traces spheres, since it is used for testing the underlying algorithm.  The HAPI directory contains the library, which is statically linked with the test programs.
The two external dependencies are jansson and freeimage, you may need to change project settings to correctly link to them.
Each program needs a display.halo file which must be in the same directory as the .exe file.  A sample one is included.
